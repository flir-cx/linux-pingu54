The Texas Instruments TMP114 implements one temperature sensor.  The
TMP114Nxxx sensor sensor is accurate to 1.0 degree from -40 to
+125째C. The 16-bit resolution of the sensor is 0.0078125 degree.  The
operating temperature has a minimum of -55째C and a maximum of +125째C.

The driver provides the common sysfs-interface for temperatures (see
